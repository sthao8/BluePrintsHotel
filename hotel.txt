Database has a table called room type, which has an id and a name of the type, single or double room. There should be a table called rooms, which has an id, a room number maybe, amount of beds, a room size, and maybe max number of beds (or how many extra beds can be added?). Table booking should have an id, a customer id, a room id, if extra beds are added, dates for start and end, and cost for the booking. For customers, there should be columns of id, name, and email address. To get free rooms given a date, we can search the bookings table for all rooms and minus those rooms from the books table, then return the rest. Given a number of people, however, we can first check the rooms to see which rooms would be able to hold that many people (ie the max occupancy), and then check the bookings to see if those rooms are free. We can generater a faktura based on the bookings + customer + room tables.
